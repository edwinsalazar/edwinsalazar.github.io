1. Instrument nopCommerce's backend
-----------------------------------

To monitor ACME's nopCommerce application, you need to install the AppDynamics .NET Agent on the Windows VM that hosts the nopCommerce application. This agent allows monitoring IIS applications, Windows services, or standalone applications. 

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

    - Install the .NET agent using the MSI installer package
    - Use the AppDynamics Agent Configuration utility to configure the .NET Agent and restart IIS
    - Verify the reported metrics on the AppDynamics controller UI

You will need the following information during this exercise:

    - Windows VM:

        - FQDN
        - Username
        - Password

    - AppDynamics SaaS Controller:

        - Host
        - Account Name
        - Account Access Key
        - Username
        - Password
        - Application Name

.. note::
   The .NET Agent MSI installer package file was previously downloaded for you and placed in the following directory ``C:\Users\fsolab\Downloads`` of your Windows IIS VM. Should you need to download the installer in the future, you can obtain it from the `AppDynamics Download Center <https://download.appdynamics.com/download/>`_.

#. Using the Microsoft Remote Desktop application, open a Remote Desktop session to your Windows VM hosted in Azure (skip this step if you are already connected).

        :align: center

    |

    i. On the `Configuration Summary` step, ensure that the **Restart IIS** checkbox is checked, then click **Next** to advance through the installer. The wizard will apply the configurations youâ€™ve selected.

    .. image:: images/dotnet-config-summary.png
        :width: 65%
        :align: center

    |

    j. When you see the status **"Finished applying configuration. Your system is ready."**, click **Next**, then **Done** to close the wizard.


#. Log into the `AppDynamics Controller UI <https://cisco-cx-ps-lab.saas.appdynamics.com/controller/>`_ using the AppDynamics account, username, and password provided by your instructor, navigate to the :guilabel:`Applications` tab, open your nopCommerce application, then click on :guilabel:`Tiers & Nodes`.

#. You should see the Web tier you created using the agent configuration utility. Then, expand it to see the Node and Agent status.

    .. image:: images/appd-tiers-nodes.png
        :width: 1200
        :align: center

    |

    .. tip::
        If the Web tier is not showing in AppDynamics UI, wait for a few minutes, and click the Refresh |refresh-button| button.

#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Application Dashboard` to visualize the application flow map.

    .. image:: images/appdNopcommerceFlowMapWithBackends.png
        :width: 1200
        :align: center

    |

    .. note::
        You may see an HTTP backend icon |http-backend-icon| with the ``x HTTP backends`` label instead of ``api.sandbox.paypal.com-443`` label.

    
    As seen in the flow map above, three backends were auto-discovered by AppDynamcis:

        1. nopCommerce DB
        2. Paypal APIs (HTTP)
        3. UPS APIs (Windows Communication Foundation or WCF)

    In AppDynamics, uninstrumented databases and remote services are collectively known as backends.

    AppDynamics discovers backends from exit point calls in the application code. An exit point is a call from an instrumented node to another node or to a backend. When the destination of an exit point call is not instrumented, the exit call results in a backend discovery event.

    We can use this information to determine what additional tests can be configured in ThousandEyes to monitor the external dependencies of our application.

    .. tip:: 
        If the application flow map is not showing in AppDynamics UI, wait for a few minutes and click the **Refresh** |refresh-button| button.

**Congratulations!** You have completed the instrumentation of the nopCommerce backend.


2. Configure On-Prem ThousandEyes Enterprise Agent
--------------------------------------------------

ACME has followed the steps in `this ThousandEyes guide <https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/global-vantage-points/enterprise-agents/installing/how-to-set-up-the-virtual-appliance>`_ to deploy, on-premise, an OVA with the ThousandEyes Enterprise Agent. However, it still needs to be configured.

In this lab, you will help the customer configure the virtual appliance and register it on ThousandEyes.

You will need the following ThousandEyes information during this exercise:
    
    - **On-Prem Enterprise Agent configuration URL**: It can be found in the :ref:`ThousandEyes resources table <teyes resource mapping>`.
    - **Enterprise Agent default username**: ``admin``
    - **Enterprise Agent default password**: ``welcome``
    - **Enterprise Agent new password**: ``WelcomeTeyes!``
    - **Account Group Token**: Provided by the instructor.
    - **On-Prem Enterprise Agent Hostname**: ``dmz-te-student-#`` (Replace the ``#`` symbol with your student number.)

.. tip::

    Check the `requirements <https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/global-vantage-points/enterprise-agents/installing/enterprise-agent-system-requirements>`_ for the agent. In addition, you can follow the `installation instructions <https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/global-vantage-points/enterprise-agents/installing/enterprise-agent-deployment-using-linux-package-method>`_.


#. The instructor will start your assigned "ThousandEyes Virtual Appliance" VM and provide the agent configuration URL. See below a screenshot of the virtual appliance welcome message captured from the VM console:

    .. image:: images/teAppliance.png
        :width: 600

3. Install ThousandEyes Enterprise Agent in Azure
-------------------------------------------------

ACME has deployed an Ubuntu 20.04 virtual machine in Azure for you to install a ThousandEyes Enterprise Agent on it. Please go through the following steps to install and register the new enterprise agent.

You will need the following ThousandEyes information during this lab exercise:

    - **Controller URL**: https://app.thousandeyes.com/
    - **Controller Credentials**: Authenticate using Cisco SSO
    - **Account Group Token**: Provided by the instructor.

.. note::
    The full list of supported Enterprise Agent Operating Systems can be found `here <https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/global-vantage-points/enterprise-agents/installing/enterprise-agent-system-requirements#supported-enterprise-agent-operating-systems>`__. In addition, you can find the official Enterprise Agent installation instructions using the  Linux package method `here <https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/global-vantage-points/enterprise-agents/installing/enterprise-agent-deployment-using-linux-package-method>`__.


#. Log in to your assigned Linux Ubuntu system.

    .. note::
        The instructor will provide Linux credentials. Replace the ``#`` symbol on the command below with your student number.


    .. code-block:: bash

        ssh fsolab@az-te-student-#.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com

#. Install available upgrades of all packages currently installed on the system:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt-get update -y

#. To avoid synchronization problems with the ThousandEyes collector it is strongly recommended that you install a Network Time Protocol (NTP) package. To download and install an NTP package, issue the following commands on the agent's host machine:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt-get -y install ntp
        sudo service ntp start
        service ntp status

#. Download and run the agent installation script. Replace the ``<Account Group Installation Token>`` with the token provided by the instructor. When prompted to change the default log path, answer ``N`` (No).

    .. code-block:: bash

        curl -Os https://downloads.thousandeyes.com/agent/install_thousandeyes.sh
        chmod +x install_thousandeyes.sh
        sudo ./install_thousandeyes.sh -b <Account Group Installation Token>

#. Open the `ThousandEyes controller <https://app.thousandeyes.com/>`_, navigate to :guilabel:`Cloud and Enterprise Agents > Agent Setting` on the left-side navigation menu and confirm that your agent named ``az-te-student-#``, where ``#`` is your student number, is listed there.

    .. image:: images/teAgent2.png
