Overview
########

The objective of this lab is to provide hands on experience to enable successful delivery of the Cisco’s Full-Stack Observability (FSO) Hybrid Cost Optimization (HCO) use case. This use case provides end to end full-stack visibility over application dependency and infrastructure components on hybrid environments with the intention to lower your costs by only paying for what you need in public cloud and by safely increasing utilization of your on-premises assets.

Needs
-----

- Lower cost by only paying for what is required on public cloud and safely increase utilization on on-premise assets and avoid application service outage due to under provisioned application resources. 

- Avoid public cloud over-provisioning and associated cost overruns as a way to ensure application performance. Variability in data transfer may also contribute to unpredictable public cloud costs​.

- Avoid underutilization of on-premises infrastructure​.

- Avoid the cost of managing multiple non-integrated tools, each responsible for only one layer of the infrastructure.


Solution
--------

- Continuous monitoring of workloads and demand-based infrastructure resource utilization and optimization.

- End to end full stack visibility over application dependency and infrastructure components on hybrid environments.

- Correlate application metrics from AppDynamics and Intersight with business KPIs.

- Correlate code-level application performance with infrastructure health.

- Get visibility into how infrastructure performance impacts end-users.

- Continuously optimize on-premises and cloud infrastructures.


Primary Products
----------------

- AppDynamics
- Intersight Workload Optimizer (IWO)


Target Teams
------------

- AppOps
- DevOps
- InfraOps
